## Project Title: Python-Web-Scraping-US-Companies

**Description**:

For this Python project, I undertook a web scraping initiative focused on the Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue. The key components of this project are as follows:

1. **Website Selection**: Chose the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue as the primary source for extracting data.
2. **Web Scraping Implementation**: Utilized Python libraries, such as BeautifulSoup and requests, to scrape tables containing information about the largest companies.
3. **Data Extraction**: Extracted relevant data from the tables, including company names, revenue figures, and other pertinent details.
4. **CSV Creation**: Compiled the extracted data into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, ensuring easy accessibility and compatibility with various data analysis tools.
